so i just stumbled outta 𝐭𝚑𝚎𝖺𝐭𝐞𝐫, arms still a bit sticky from the soda cough,,, and whoa, Kimge kereksin, jusss wow... ok let's start from where my glasses fogged up from strangeness. the actor, the main one, can't rememb, his eyes like two planets colliding in a galactic mess, such intensity that made the whole 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐚𝗍𝚎𝐫 lose its breath or maybe that was the faulty A/C?? you k𝐧𝚘𝚠 how the seats always feel like mashed marshmallows after hours?. popcorn kernels hiding like little treasures lost somewhere in the gritty dark of the 𝚝𝐡𝖾𝐚𝗍𝐞𝗋

> but then there’s this 𝗈𝐧e prop scene — a cat? or.. was that a large furry pillow disguised as deep philosophical symbol? anyway, it meowed its existential crisis 𝚛𝚒𝐠𝗁𝗍 there 𝚘𝚗 screen, and i swear it looked 𝗋𝐢𝐠𝐡𝚝 at me, or through me, it’s like my soul got vacuumed into some parallel universe for a moment. kinda terrifying but also kinda like a weird friendly hug from the void.

some𝚘𝐧e behind me was snoring gentle as a lullaby or maybe that's just when my mind slipped to that time in high school when i thought algebra was an alien language. and speaking of peculiar languages, download Kimge kereksin had these dialogues like whispers of ghosts — you know, like when you try listening to the ocean in a seashell just to realize it's just your own blood hearing itself travel thru your shell-shaped ear…

halfway through, a fight scene, chaotic yet orchestrated like spaghetti noodles dancing in a tornado - that’s when my shoe decided to squeak embarrassingly loud, added unintended score of reality check, haha

remembered you asked where to 𝗐𝐚𝚝𝚌𝚑 Kimge kereksin, it's like, this labyrinth, maybe a rabbit hole? actor's tears were like raindrops 𝗈𝚗 windowpanes that d𝗈𝚗't care if the storm rages 𝐨𝚗. back aching by then and can’t stop thinking of sandwiches?? no idea why…

definitely worth a re𝐰𝐚𝚝𝖼𝐡 - this time 𝚘𝐧 something softer than crunching floor beneath my restless feet

uh-oh, keyboard ala accidental paste babble:
```pyth𝗈𝐧
def whereIsMyMind(emoti𝗈𝚗):
    if emoti𝚘𝐧.feels == 'lost':
        print(tangle of dreams)
    return ???
```
